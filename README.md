### Sample Games
- [Birdland](https://birdland.camp/) 
   - A surrealist piece of interactive fiction
   - Uses variables to store "mood levels" that prevent/let you take certain actions
   - [Reviews of Birdland](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ap1651hvjldbuugj) - The game is novella-length (although can be paused at will, but I'd strongly suggest at least reading the reviews and playing a bit of it.
- [SPENT](http://playspent.org/html/)
   - Play as an unemployed adult forced to make tough choices
   - More gamified than some of the others
   - Educational, helps players understand experiences that may be foreign to their own
- [Queers In Love at the End of the World](https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world)
   - Very personal and emotional
   - Shows how Twine can be extended with more features like a timer
- [Games by Porpentine](http://slimedaughter.com/games/)
   - One of the most well-known Twine writers/creators
   - Some games very NSFW - proceed at your own risk
